## **Statistical Analysis of Toronto Traffic Collisions**

Performs statistical hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between traffic collisions, weather conditions, and automated speed enforcement (ASE) camera presence across Toronto. The objective is to determine whether factors such as precipitation, snow on the ground, and temperature significantly influence collision frequency, and whether collisions differ in areas with or without camera coverage.

### **Files Included**
- **`Statistical_Tests.ipynb`** — Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests, correlation analysis).  

---

### **Key Insights**
- The **t-test results** suggest a **statistically significant difference** in average collision counts between days **with snow on the ground and without** (*p* < 0.05).  
- **No significant relationship** was observed between **precipitation** and collision frequency (*p* > 0.05), though a weak positive correlation (r ≈ 0.12) was found.  
- Areas **without ASE cameras** experienced a **higher mean collision frequency**, indicating potential coverage gaps.  
- Overall, weather factors accounted for **minor variations**, suggesting that **infrastructure and traffic volume** may play a larger role in collision density.

### **Next Steps**
The next phase involves developing an **optimization model** to determine ideal camera placement.  
This model will integrate:
- Collision frequency  
- Camera coverage  
- Installation and maintenance costs  
- Potential biases (e.g., neighborhood income or population density)  

The goal is to maximize **traffic safety impact** while ensuring **cost-effectiveness and equitable deployment** across Toronto.
