# Speed Cameras and Collision Hotspots: A Toronto Case Study

An analysis of traffic collision patterns and speed camera placement in Toronto to evaluate the effectiveness of automated speed enforcement (ASE) in reducing collision frequency and severity.

## Project Objective

This project investigates whether Toronto's speed cameras are effectively located to improve road safety. Specifically, it aims to answer:

- Are traffic collisions less severe near active speed cameras?
- Do high-collision areas have sufficient speed camera coverage?
- Where should new speed cameras be placed to maximize their impact on traffic safety?
