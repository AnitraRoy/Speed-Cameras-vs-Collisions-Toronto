# Optimization Model
To address misalignment between Toronto’s current collision density and camera coverage, a maximum-coverage optimization model was developed based on the regression model, incorporating collision frequency, severity weighting, camera coverage radii, and candidate sites derived from the spatial analyses.

The optimized locations significantly increased collision coverage from the baseline 27% to **68%**.
